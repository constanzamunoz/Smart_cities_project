For these reasons an appropriate way of modeling and control strategies should be applied in order to develop more efficient buildings that allow to reduce both consumption and emissions.\n\nThe simulation that is carried out in this project is devoted to define a virtual model of a house, accounting as much details as possible, in order to create an accurate approximation of real life behavior. Energy and mass flows between different spaces are considered to correctly assess the energy consumptions required to heat up and cool down the house.\n\nThe required inputs for this simulation are:\n* Weather conditions of the site in analysis (Grenoble 38000, France)\n* Building geometry\n* Building envelope characteristics","metadata":{},"id":"25509213-8614-43f0-bd50-ace87ce46e94"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### BUILDING PLAN\nThe place considered for analysis is a flat of almost 25m2 facing south located at the third floor of a residence in Grenoble. The studio has 4 general walls, a separated bathroom, a main door and a window with the previous orientation mentioned. The materials of each wall is concrete covered with an insulation layer, the bathroom door is made of wood and the main door is made of iron whilst the window is double layered. Inside there’s electrical equipment that apport heat such as the computer, microwave, induction stove, fridge, and heater. The place will be occupied by one person who does home-office; hence, the importance of the analysis since each day a strong heat production will be generated inside the room. The studio will require a set point for temperature control and regulation; therefore, the objective is to determine the characteristics of this equipment to work at the optimal level.\n![Drawingstudio](studio_drawing.PNG)\n","metadata":{},"id":"952703bb-4f0f-4fa4-96c9-a26c949cc55f"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### HYPOTHESES\nThe following considerations were taken into account for the design, model, and implementation:\n* The effect of surrounding buildings is neglected when considering the solar radiation effect.\n* The wall besides the bathroom door is not considered in the analysis\n* The insulator section of the wall includes a hard wall finishing for construction purposes.\n* The only set point is considered in the main room.\n* The two walls in contact with other rooms of the building don't have an influence on the model (North and East walls) because the difference of temperature between the rooms is considered 0.","metadata":{},"id":"0fae6b97-b3ba-4c60-937e-d23f17a51fc1"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### THERMAL MODEL\nFor the thermal analysis the following design is proposed.\n![Thermalmodel](diagram.PNG)\n\nThis design accounts the walls in contact with the exterior (South and East), the window at the south wall, \nthe wall between the bathroom and the main room, the wall between the bathroom and the exterior; and finally the wood door to access the bathroom.\n","metadata":{},"id":"ec07a53a-26a5-4a6a-91de-6b1f509b5e61"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### MATHEMATICAL MODEL\n\nThe thermal circuit matrices generated for the model are presented: ","metadata":{},"id":"52a149e1-fea3-4a88-ab09-281aa3569cdc"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"Matrix \"A\" is:\n\nThis matrix has x lines in accordance to the number of flows and columns are related to the number of temperature nodes.\nThe coefficients are either -1 or 1 depending on the direction of the flow, either exiting or entering respectively.\n\nMatrix \"b\" is:\n\nThis vector depicts the temperature sources.
